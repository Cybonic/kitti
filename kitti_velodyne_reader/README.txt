Requirements:
--> CMake 2.8 or higher
--> PCL 1.2 or higher

To compile the code:
--> Run cmake .
--> Run make

To run the executable generated by make:
--> ./velodyne_reader

Tip: Press "R" on the keyboard once the PCL window appears in order to normalize the camera view angle. Otherwise, simply zoom out using the mouse roller.

Suggestions:
		To install PCL, use the following command on an Ubuntu terminal
		sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpcl1.7 libpcl-dev pcl-tools

		If you get the error No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so' while running the make command, do the following:
		sudo apt install libproj-dev
		Add the following line to the CMakeLists.txt file and run cmake . again to generate the Makefile.
		list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")

		When you clone the repository on your local machine, make sure to delete CMakeCache.txt, cmake_install.cmake, Makefile, velodyne_reader (executable) and the directory CMakeFiles. The only remaining files should be README.txt, velodyne_reader.cpp and CMakeLists.txt.
