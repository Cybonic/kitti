Requirements:
--> CMake 2.8 or higher
--> PCL 1.2 or higher

To compile the code:
--> Run cmake .
--> Run make

To run the executable generated by make:
--> ./velodyne_reader

Suggestions:
		To install PCL, use the following command on an Ubuntu terminal
		sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libpcl1.7 libpcl-dev pcl-tools

		If you get the error No rule to make target '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproj.so' while running the make command, do the following:
		sudo apt install libproj-dev
		Add the following line to the CMakeLists.txt file and run cmake . again to generate the Makefile:
		list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")

		Press "R" on the keyboard once the PCL window appears in order to normalize the camera view angle. Otherwise, simply zoom out using the mouse roller.

		Currently, the filepaths to and the filanames of the .bin Velodyne LiDAR files are listed manually in the code. Only 40 files are listed. The code can be modified to change the number of .bin files read or to automate this process instead of doing it manually.

		The delay between successive LiDAR frames is currently set as 1 second (1 million micro-seconds) in a global variable named "delay". This can be altered to slow down or speed up the data playback.
